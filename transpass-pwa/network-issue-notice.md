# Important Notice: Network/Connectivity Issues with Firebase

We're experiencing consistent "NOT_FOUND" errors while trying to connect to Firebase, despite having:
1. Properly configured Firebase credentials
2. Created a Firestore database in the Firebase Console with the correct name
3. Set appropriate security rules

## Likely Causes

These errors typically occur due to one of these issues:

1. **Network Connectivity Issue**: The environment where the code is running may have network restrictions preventing connection to Firebase services.

2. **Firestore Database Propagation Delay**: When a new Firestore database is created in Firebase Console, it can take some time (up to a few hours) for it to fully propagate and become accessible.

3. **Region Mismatch**: The region selected for the Firestore database (eur3) might need to be explicitly specified in the Firebase configuration.

4. **Service Account Permissions**: The service account may not have the correct permissions to access the Firestore database.

## Recommendations

Since we're unable to connect to Firebase for database operations at this time, we have two options:

1. **Wait for Database Propagation**: Continue with frontend development tasks, and attempt database operations later (after a few hours) when the Firestore database has fully propagated.

2. **Network Configuration**: If you're running this in a restricted network environment, you may need to allow outbound connections to Firebase services.

## Next Steps

Let's proceed with implementing the frontend tasks that don't require active database connectivity:

1. Complete QR scanner implementation in QRScanner.tsx
2. Implement missing UI components on the homepage
3. Create content for footer-linked pages

After completing these tasks, we can attempt the database-dependent tasks once the connectivity issues are resolved.

For testing purposes, we can create mock data objects to simulate database responses until the real database is accessible.
